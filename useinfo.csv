1892 "The 1890 McKinley Tarriff is introduced, taxing imports by 50% to protect domestic industry. The Republicans supported ever-increasing rates, whereas a substantial wing of the Democratic party pushed through a platform plank that demanded import taxes for revenue only. The Populists called for government ownership of the railroads and monetary reform, confronting these issues in a way the two major parties did not."
1896 "The Republican party’s platform stressed adherence to the gold standard; the Democratic party endorsed the coinage of silver at a ratio of sixteen to one."
1900 "The Democratic Nominee campaigned as an anti-imperialist, denouncing the country’s involvement in the Philippines. Delivering over six hundred speeches in twenty-four states, he also persisted in his crusade for the free coinage of silver; William McKinley, the sitting president and Republican nominee, did not actively campaign."
1904 "Democrats away from bimetallism and toward progressivism, their nominee Alton Parker and his campaign attacked Republican nominee Roosevelt, who had become interim president when McKinley was assassinated for his antitrust policies and for accepting contributions from big business."
1908 "The Republicans nominate Secretary of War William Taft, who promises to continue Roosevelt’s reformist natures, and strongly supported by business leaders. Former two-time Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan is nominated a third time and loses."
1912 "Angered at Taft’s term, Roosevelt runs against Taft in the Republican primaries, but is not selected as nominee. He then forms his own party, the Progressive ‘Bull Moose’ party, which outperforms the Republican Party in the general election, the only independent party to ever do so."
1916 "The Progressive party hopes to renominate Roosevelt, who instead seeks to reunify the Republican Party, and rallies behind Republican nominee Charles Fairbanks. The Democrats renominate Woodrow Wilson, who had until then been successful in keeping the nation out of the European war, who wins by a slim margin."
1920 "After a generation of progressive insurgency within the Republican party, it returned in 1920 to a conservative stance. Democratic chances were weakened by President Woodrow Wilson’s having suffered a stroke in 1919 and his failure to obtain ratification of the League of Nations treaty; James Cox was nominated instead. The election was a strong rejection of President Wilson and an endorsement of the Republican candidate’s call for a “return to normalcy.”"
1924 "In choosing their candidates the Democrats were faced with polar opposites. Alfred E. Smith of New York was the epitome of the urban machine politician, and he was also Catholic; William G. McAdoo was a Protestant popular in the South and West. The Republicans won easily; Coolidge’s popular vote, 15,725,016, was greater than all other candidates combined, and Coolidge swept the electoral college with 382 votes to Davis’s 136. "
1928 "The Eighteenth Amendment (Prohibition) and religion were major issues — the Republican nominee Herbert Hoover supported the Prohibition, whereas Smith favoured repeal. Many Americans found the urban and cultural groups Smith epitomized frightening; Hoover seemed to stand for old-fashioned rural values. The Republican campaign slogan promised the people “a chicken for every pot and a car in every garage.”"
1932 "The Great Depression has devastated the economic livelihoods of many Americans. Sitting president Herbert Hoover defends his record, his commitment to a balanced budget, and the gold standard –a backward-looking stance, given that the number of unemployed stands at 13 million. Roosevelt made few specific proposals, but his tone and demeanor were positive and forward-looking. The Democrats win by the popular vote by almost 20%, and sweep the electoral college by 472 to 59 votes."
1936 "The Republican Party is strongly opposed to the New Deal and “big government”, accusing the Democratic Roosevelt of trying to centralise the economy, take away American individualism, and threaten national liberty. The Democrats form coalitions with farmers, industrial workers, and a historic number of African-American voters turn Democrat, allowing the Democrats to sweep the election by 11 million votes, and the electoral college 523 to 8."
1940 "The major issue facing the American people in 1940 was World War II. Democratic President Roosevelt was nominated for an unprecedented third term, with Republican nominee Willkie crusaded against Roosevelt's attempt to break the two-term presidential tradition, arguing that ""if one man is indispensable, then none of us is free.” Ultimately, Roosevelt’s ‘New Deal’ had been very effective, and his substantial military buildup helped him win the popular vote by 5 million votes, and sweep the electoral college 449 to 82."
1944 "In the midst of World War II, Roosevelt ran for his fourth term, changing his vice president to Missouri governor Harry S. Truman to replace Henry Wallace, who Democratic Party regulars disliked. The slogan “Don’t change horses in midstream” was frequently used in his campaign to combat the question of whether any president should be able to serve four terms. Familiarity ultimately prevailed, and he defeated Republican nominee governor Thomas Dewey of New York in the general elections, winning the popular vote by 3 million and the elector college 432 to 99."
1948 "When Truman declined to run for a third term, the Democrats nominated Illinois Governor Adlai E. Stevenson with Alabama Senator John Sparkman as running mate. The Republican fight was between the isolationist Senator Robert Taft of Ohio, and liberal internationalists Dwight D. Eisenhower, then president of Columbia University. Eisenhower won the nomination, with Richard M. Nixon, an anticommunist senator from California, as the VP candidate. Popular discontent with Truman’s handling of the Korean War, charges of corruption, an inflationary economy, a perceived communist threat and Eisenhower’s immense personal popularity helped him secure victory. He won the popular vote 33,936,234 to 27,314,992, and the electoral college 442 to 89."
1952 "President Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated by the Republicans for a second term without opposition. Again, the Democrats chose Adlai E. Stevenson with running mate Estes Kefauver. Foreign policy dominated the campaign. Eisenhower claimed responsibility for the country’s being prosperous and at peace; Stevenson proposed ending the draft and halting nuclear testing. In the final weeks of the campaign, The Suez Canal crisis created a sense of emergency, and the country voted strongly against change. Eisenhower won the popular vote 35,590,472 to 26,022,752, and the electoral college 457 to 73."
1956 "In 1960 the Democrats John F. Kennedy, a senator from Massachusetts, with Texas senator Lyndon B. Johnson as running mate. The Republicans nominated Vice President Richard M. Nixon to succeed Eisenhower, prohibited from running for a third term by the recent 22nd Amendment with Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. as running mate. Much of the campaign centered on style rather than substance, with Kennedy claiming a “missile gap” between the United States and the Soviet Union. Kennedy was Catholic, which had considerable influence on many voters. Kennedy won the presidency by less than 120,000 popular votes, receiving 34,227,096, but decisively won the electoral college 303 to 219. Kennedy was the first Catholic and the youngest person to be elected president."
1960 "The Democrats nominated Lyndon B. Johnson (who'd assumed presidency after the assassination of President Kennedy), with Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota as running mate. The Republicans chose Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona and Congressman William E. Miller of New York for VP. In the midst an escalating war in Vietnam, Goldwater, an ultraconservative, called for the bombing of North Vietnam and the dismantling of Social Security. President Johnson campaigned on a platform of social reform incorporating Kennedy’s New Frontier proposals, and as a candidate of peace (despite deepning involvement). Johnson won decisevely, 43,128,958 to 27,176,873 in the popular vote and 486 to 52 in the electoral college."
1964 "The Vietnam War, the civil rights movement and protests were the most pressing issues of the time. Nixon campaigned for law and order with a “secret plan” to end the war. The Democrats nominated VP Humphrey with Edmund Muskie as running mate. The conservative American Independent Party nominated Governor George Wallace, a segregationist, and Air Force general Curtis LeMay, who advocated using nuclear weapons in Vietnam. Wallace was critical of Supreme Court decisions that had broadened the Bill of Rights and of Great Society programs to rebuild the inner cities and enforce civil rights for blacks.  Nixon won the popular vote 31,710,470 to 30,898,05, and 302 to 191; Wallace received 9,466,167 and 46."
1968 "In 1972 the Republicans nominated President Nixon and VP Spiro Agnew. The Democrats, split over war in Vietnam, chose Senator George McGovern of South Dakota. The campaign focused on peace in Vietnam and an upsurge in the economy. Unemployment had leveled off and the inflation rate was declining. The campaign ended in one of the greatest landslides in the nation’s history. Nixon’s popular vote was 47,169,911 to McGovern’s 29,170,383, and the Republican victory in the Electoral College was even more lopsided at 520 to 17. Only Massachusetts gave its votes to McGovern."
1972 "In 1976 the Democratic Party nominated former governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia for president and Senator Walter Mondale of Minnesota for vice president. The Republicans chose President Gerald Ford and Senator Robert Dole of Kansas. In the campaign, Carter ran as an outsider, independent of Washington, which was now in disrepute. Ford tried to justify his pardoning Nixon for any crimes he might have committed during the cover-up, as well as to overcome the disgrace many thought the Republicans had brought to the presidency. Carter and Mondale won a narrow victory, 40,828,587 popular votes to 39,147,613 and 297 electoral votes to 241. The Democratic victory ended eight years of divided government; the party now controlled both the White House and Congress."
1976 "In 1980 President Jimmy Carter was opposed for the Democratic nomination by Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts in ten primaries; Carter easily won the nomination at the Democratic convention. Ronald Reagan, former governor of California, received the Republican nomination, and his chief challenger, George Bush, became the vice-presidential nominee. The two major issues of the campaign were the economy and the Iran Hostage Crisis. President Carter seemed unable to control inflation and had not succeeded in obtaining the release of American hostages in Tehran before the election. The Republicans gained Senate control for the 1st time in twenty-five years. Reagan swept the popular vote 43,904,153 to Carter's 35,483,883, and the electoral college 489 to 49. John Anderson got 5,720,060 popular votes."
1980 "In 1984 the Republicans renominated Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Walter Mondale was the Democratic choice, after a strong battle against Revered Jesse Jackson and Senator Gary Hart. Mondale chose Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York for his running mate, marking the first time a major party nominated a woman for a top office. Peace and prosperity, despite massive budget deficits, ensured Reagan’s victory; Ferraro’s nomination did not overcome a perceived gender gap, as 56 percent of voting women chose Reagan. He won the popular vote 54,455,074 to 37,577,185, and the electoral college 525 to 13, carrying all states except Minnesota, Mondale’s home state, and the District of Columbia."
1984 "Ronald Reagan, former governor of California, received the Republican nomination, and his chief challenger, George Bush, became the vice-presidential nominee. Representative John B. Anderson of Illinois, who had also sought the nomination, ran as an independent with Patrick J. Lucey, former Democratic governor of Wisconsin, as his running mate. The two major issues of the campaign were the economy and the Iran Hostage Crisis. President Carter seemed unable to control inflation and had not succeeded in obtaining the release of American hostages in Tehran before the election. Reagan won a landslide victory, and Republicans also gained control of the Senate for the first time in twenty-five years. Reagan swept the popular vote 43,904,153  to 35,483,883, and the electoral college 489 votes to 49. "
1988 "In 1988, Vice President George Bush won the Republican nomination by acclamation, choosing Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as running mate. The Democrats nominated Michael Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts and Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as running mate. Dukakis had faced strong opposition in the primaries, but party regulars and political pundits perceived opponent Jesse Jackson, a liberal and an African-American, as unlikely to win the general election. The Republicans ran in an enviable situation of relative tranquility and economic stability. After a campaign featuring controversial television ads, Bush and Quayle won the popular vote 48,886,097 to 41,809,074, and the electoral college 426 to 111."
1992 "In 1991 incumbent President George H. W. Bush’s approval ratings reached 88 percent, the highest in presidential history up to that point. But by 1992, his ratings had sunk, and Bush became the fourth sitting U.S. president to lose re-election. In the summer of 1992 Ross Perot led the polls with 39 percent of voter support. Although Perot came in a distant third, he was still the most successful third-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. Clinton won the popular Vote: 44,908,254 to Bush’s 39,102,343 and the electoral college 370 to 168."
1996 "Although Clinton won a decisive victory, he carried a mere four Southern states, signaling a decline in Southern support for Democrats who historically could count on the area as an electoral stronghold. Later, in the elections of 2000 and 2004, Democrats did not carry a single Southern state. Election funding skyrocketed, increasing 33% over the last election. The Democratic National Committee was accused of accepting donations from Chinese contributors. Non-American citizens are forbidden by law from donating to U.S. politicians and 17 people were later convicted for the activity. Clinton won the nomination 45,590,703 to Dole’s 37,816,307, and the electoral College 379 to 159."
2000 "The 2000 election was the fourth election in U.S. history in which the winner of the electoral votes did not carry the popular vote. It was the first such election since 1888, when Benjamin Harris became president after winning more electoral votes but losing the popular vote to Grover Cleveland. Gore conceded on election night but retracted his concession the next day when he learned that the vote in Florida was too close to call, and demanded a recount, eventually ruled by the Supreme Court as unconstiutional. Political activist Ralph Nader ran on the Green Party ticket and captured 2.7 percent of the vote. Gore won the popular vote 50,996,582 to 50,465,062, but lost the electoral college 266 to Bush’s 271."
2004 "Total voter turnout for the 2004 presidential election numbered at about 120 million, an impressive 15 million increase from the 2000 vote. After the bitterly contested election of 2000, many were poised for a similar election battle in 2004. Although there were reported irregularities in Ohio, a recount confirmed the original vote counts with nominal differences that did not affect the final outcome. Bush won the popular vote 60,693,281 to Democratic nominee John Kerry's 57,355,978, and electoral college 286 to 251."
2008 "In this historic election, Barack Obama became the first African-American to become president. With the Obama/Biden win, Biden became the first-ever Roman Catholic vice president. Had the McCain/Palin ticket won, John McCain would have been the oldest president in history, and Sarah Palin would have been the first woman vice president. Obama won the popular vote 69,297,997 to 59,597,520, and the electoral College 365 to 173."
2012 "Romney, the first Mormon to receive a major party’s nomination, fought off a number of Republican challengers in the primary, while the incumbent Obama faced no intra-party challenges. The election, the first waged following the “Citizens United” Supreme Court decision that allowed for increased political contributions, cost more than $2.6 billion, with the two major party candidates spending close to $1.12 billion that cycle. Obama won the popular vote 65,915,795 to 60,933,504, and the electoral college 332 to 206."
2016 "The 2016 election was unconventional in its level of divisiveness. Former first lady, New York Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first woman to be nominated by a major party in a U.S. presidential election. Donald Trump, a New York real estate baron and reality TV star, was quick to mock fellow Republicans running for the nomination as well as his democratic opponent. In what many political analysts considered a stunning upset, Trump, with his populist, nationalist campaign, lost the popular vote, but won the Electoral College, becoming the nation's 45th president. Clinton won the popular Vote: 65,853,516 to 62,984,825, but lost the electoral College: 306 to 232."
